  <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>

  <!-- TODO: (Practice II) edit part of this paragraph. -->
  <p>
    This will be a well executed team project. We are going to create a deep neural net using blockchain and bigger
    data.
    Our client is the government of Wakanda. We plan to meet every fifteen hours at least once every week for status
    check-ups. Our group
    consists of a fire-fighter, three ninjas and an angry unicorn. If we worked together as a group our chance of
    surviving the zombie apocalypse is 3.82%.
    We plan to build an interactive website.
