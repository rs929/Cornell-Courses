# Reflection

## Which version of the website was your group given (A, B, or C)?

- [X] Website A

    Cornell has asked you to build a website for helping current undergraduates plan trips home for breaks. They're not sure what students are looking for, so they've tasked you with gathering information and creating the website.

- [ ] Website B

    The City of Ithaca wants to encourage Ithaca undergraduate students to engage with local businesses rather than just buying everything from online retailers. To do this, they've asked you to create a website to inform students about local businesses and encourage them to shop at these businesses.

- [ ] Website C

    Cornell has asked you to build a website to inform current undergraduates about construction, closures, and events on campus that may impact them (think sidewalk closures on East Ave or Dragon Day). They have asked you to find out what information would be helpful to students and create a website with this information.

## Interview Notes
> When interviewing your peer, use this space to write your notes.

Disney World: typically wake up to hotel, eat breakfast at hotel, and often follow an itinerary, and usually from 9-7, going on rides, and different showcases, giftshop, and trying foods

usually talkative, like talking to people around, and ask them about specific things. If alone on traveling, keep to yourself, but if they start conversation, then will continue


## Interview Reflection
> What useful and relevant information did you get from your interview? (1 paragraph)

I got useful information about from the questions about thought processes and possible scheudles and routines that our potential users would have when they are planning on going on a trip from Cornell

> What information did you get that was not useful or relevant? (1 paragraph)

Information that I got that was not as useful was moreso infomration about specific events and activities that were completed, as they would be too specific to apply to a larger portion of the population

> Which of your questions need improvement based on the value of the responses they got? (1 sentence about each question)

I think that question 2 and 5 need improvemnet since they are still too general, and more clarification and direction was givenn to make the question more directed.
