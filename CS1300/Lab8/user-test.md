# Lab 8: User Testing Practice

## Tasks

These are the four tasks you will evaluate during user testing. Write tasks 3 and 4 based on the persona above.

1. Look up if the Wi-Fi in Balch Hall and evaluate if it's strong enough for streaming movies.

2. Your regular study location on Campus is the President's room in Uris Library. Last week a notice was posted on the door that the Wi-Fi will be out the following week for network upgrades. Locate an alternative study location close by in another building that has very strong Wi-Fi. (Note: This is a scenario. A scenario is a task with some additional context. If you prefer, here is just the task: Locate an alternative study location close by Uris Library that has very strong Wi-Fi.)

3. Try to find the location with the fastest WiFi

4. Find information about the connection strength at Goldwyn Smith Hall


## User Test Notes

Using the procedure posted to Canvas, user test each of the above tasks with a peer. See the lab write-up for additional instructions. **Take notes here.**

**Organize your notes by tasks.** A grader should not need to guess which notes are associated with which task.

### Task X Notes

- Struggled to find info on location speeds. Name of tab is decieving
- Found after exploring further all the tabs since the website is small
- Not ideal organization so user found it difficult to find the information

### Task Y Notes

- Clicked "best places" and then clicked on "location info"
- Needs to specify that the Location info needs to specify connection
- Both the places and the locations tab imply that there is information regarding locations for wifi so user would get confused when trying to determine the difference between the two


## Reflection

> Which tasks (1-4) did the user successfully complete? Which tasks did the user fail to complete?

The user was not able to complete many of the tasks as the website navigation bar information does not accurately convey the information about the content that is displayed on that tab.


> What information did you get that was helpful?

Information that I got that was helpful that I received information about the organizaton of the site and how possible users would respond to the information about the navigatiopn bar, and what they thought what was in the contenet displayed within them.


> What information did you get that was not useful or relevant?

Since the questions were pretty specific and guided, I did not really get any information that was not useful to me. Being able to see the process of the user moving through the site gave useful insights on the thought process and actions of potential users


> What parts of the website do you think need improvement based on your user tests?

The navigation bar information needs work in terms of the information that it displays, as the tab names are not indicative of the content displayed within them


> Reflect on the tasks. Are these _good_ tasks? Did testing them result in useful data? Would you change/improve them in any way?

The tasks were good as they were directed and specific and they asked users to complete a task using an action word. it gave a lot of insight on the flaws of the website, specificalluy in terms of user comprehension
