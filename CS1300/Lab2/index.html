        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p>We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we hope you come visit soon. Whether you stop by once while you're passing through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is ready to welcome you with open arms.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Advisory: </strong>due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to make sure they bring sunscreen for protection from ultraviolet rays and a water bottle to help stay hydrated. We have water fountains all over the zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say <strong>"Watering Hole."</strong></em></p>

        <h1>About the Zoo</h1>

        <ul>

            <li>Founded in <strong>1972</strong>, we've proudly hosted tourists from <strong>37</strong> countries and thousands of local visitors from Tompkins county.
            </li>
            <li>For over <strong>45</strong> years, we've been committed to our primary mission: conservation and protection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Featured Animals</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptopsaras Couesii:</strong>
                Commonly called the Triplewart Seadevil, this angler fish that uses a glowing lure on its head to attract prey.</li>
            <li><strong>Ailurus Fulgens:</strong>
                Commonly called the Red Panda, this fluffy creature is actually more closely related to raccoons than giant pandas.</li>
            <li><strong>Giraffa Camelopardalis Reticulata:</strong>
                Although there are many kinds of giraffes in the wild, this is the kind most commonly found in zoos around the world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Animals</h3>

        <p>We host a wide variety of animals in climate-controlled biomes designed to perfectly match their natural environments.</p>

        <p>Our many viewing platforms and walkways provide incredible views of our animals but keep guests at a safe distance.</p>

        <p>This is to keep you safe from them, and them safe from you.</p>

        <p>However, there are a few animals that are safe for you to feed in supervised sessions.</p>

        <p>Just look for the happy zookeeper sign along edge of the enclosure to learn about the time and location for these opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Main Attractions</h3>

        <p>In addition to our wonderful animals, the zoo includes a fully functional food court featuring some of Ithaca’s best chefs.</p>
