# Rationale For Lab Homework 4

## What were the emotions/ideas you wanted to convey?

The emotions that I want to convey are adventure, exotic, fun, interesting, educational

## How did you use CSS styling to theme the site with that emotion/idea?

I wanted to style the theme of the website to be adventurous and curious, but also calm at the same time to signify taking the time to enjoy the wildlife and nature. I decided to use a light shade of sage with forest green text boxes. I also set a border radius to make all the elements look a lot smoother and less sharp looking to convey a sense of peace/ serenity.
